The Intelligent Journal App with RAG Pipeline is designed to transform traditional journaling into an active, reflective companion. Instead of serving as passive storage, the app uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow to surface relevant past entries and generate contextual insights whenever a new note is written. By combining semantic search with generative summaries, it helps students recall exam prep reflections, professionals revisit meeting logs, patients track health diaries, and individuals reflect on personal growth. This dynamic feedback loop not only improves clarity and emotional regulation but also scales into education, healthcare, and corporate knowledge management, evolving into a smarter system that grows with the user.
